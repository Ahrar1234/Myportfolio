# Security Improvements

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Added CSP header to prevent XSS attacks
- Restricts script and style sources to trusted domains
- Allows only HTTPS connections for external resources

### 2. Input Sanitization
- Implemented HTML entity encoding for form inputs
- Prevents script injection through contact form
- Validates email format with regex

### 3. Error Handling
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Prevents sensitive error information exposure
- Graceful degradation for failed operations

### 4. Performance Security
- Added `will-change` CSS properties for optimized animations
- Implemented `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth scrolling
- Added passive event listeners for better performance

### 5. Accessibility & Security
- Added proper focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- Implemented ARIA labels for screen readers
- Added `crossorigin` attribute for external scripts

### 6. Data Protection
- Added referrer policy for privacy protection
- Implemented secure form validation
- No sensitive data stored in localStorage

## Security Best Practices Applied

1. **Input Validation**: All form inputs are validated and sanitized
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling prevents information leakage
3. **Performance**: Optimized animations prevent UI blocking
4. **Accessibility**: Proper focus management and ARIA labels
5. **Content Security**: CSP headers prevent code injection
6. **Privacy**: Referrer policy protects user navigation data

## Recommendations for Production

1. Use HTTPS for all connections
2. Implement server-side form validation
3. Add rate limiting for form submissions
4. Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
5. Implement proper logging and monitoring
6. Regular security audits and updates
